Certificate of Cybersecurity - ISC2

This is my study notes / printout I used to study prior to exam. The exam was harder than I expected but was an entry / fundamental course. If you have a background in IT you can almost pass without studying more than a few hours. There were several questions I wish I had studied / paid more attention in the lead up.

If you do not have any background in IT, you should take your time and study additionally. You will benefit from knowing common ports, network commands / techniques, and even understanding IP Addressing will help. This will make things more difficult if new to the industry but the provided learning material is excellent. Take your time and do not be ashamed about redoing the material. It takes time to wrap your brain around new concepts.

ISC2 provides both Quizzes and Flashcards, this is an excellent way to gauge your abilities.

What is “Certified in Cybersecurity (CC)”?

This is a currently ‘free’ course offered by (ISC)2 and enables you to become a member and serves as an entry point in cybersecurity. You will need to pay a 50$USD membership fee in order to receive your certificate. This is an annual membership fee. 
One of the many benefits to members is discounts on future courses. So much like AWS, it is cost effective to start with an entry course and take advantage of savings as you progress on your learning journey.
